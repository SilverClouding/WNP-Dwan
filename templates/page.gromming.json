Our pet groomers are specially trained to handle your furry friend gently to create a pleasant experience that is essential to your companion's health and well-being. Choose from a Mini Groom or Full Groom to suit your preferences. Grooming is not just about smelling good, but it is also about removing loose fur, trimming nails, maintaining good dental hygiene, and preventing ear infections.<br\/><br\/>Regular grooming can be done once a month, but it is recommended to bring your dog in for a grooming session if your furry friend shows tear stains, has long nails, has matted fur or has full anal glands.
